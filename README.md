`NetworKit` is a library which implements the `NWC-Protocol`. The `NWC-Protocol` is proprietary networking protocol which implements a small and leighweight header with a performance as fast as raw tcp performance. Build directly on top of apples `Network` framework with support for plain tcp and tls encrypted connections. The implementation for the host is [Network-GO](https://github.com/Vinz1911/network-go) written in golang with awesome concurrency support to ensure maximum performance.
